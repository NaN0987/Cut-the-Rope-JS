# Cut-the-Rope-JS

This is an old windows 8 app of "Cut the Rope" that has been modified so it will run in a modern browser. All features related to Windows (leaderboards, achievements, etc.) have been disabled, but all other parts of the game still function unless specified below. 

Important things to note:
 - The game's speed is tied to your device's refresh rate. Please run the game at 60fps.
 - The menu buttons in the top right of a level currently don't work. You're still able to pause by clicking out of the tab and then clicking back in.
 - The settings also don't work. On desktop they will appear on the left side of the screen.
 - Your progress WILL be saved in your browser.
 - The exact version number is as follows: 1.1.0.33_x86
